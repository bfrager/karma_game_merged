#Inspiration
We wanted to test our newfound Javascript skills on an exciting platform developing rapidly along with the gaming and VR landscapes: Unity. We set out to build capture-the-flag style win logic into a first person shooter environment.

#Project Creation Approach
We immersed ourselves in Unity tutorials before honing in on game mechanics that would fall within the scope of a 1-week project.

We settled on a GA-centric throwback to the old Counterstrike days, with a little Halo capture-the-flag thrown in the mix. Somehow we pulled off an MVP (thanks <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/" target="_blank">Unity documentation</a>).

#Technologies Used
<ul>
	<li>Unity 3D</li>
	<li>3D Studio Max</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>

	<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

#User Stories
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Taylor</strong>: 20s, tech-savvy, power-producer. Taylor wants to take out her frustration at her brilliant but elusive instructors in a healthy forum. She logs into the game, punches them all in the face a little bit, shoots them with rainbow lasers, dons Tony's gold chain, and continues her day with renewed focus and calm feeling like a g**d***ed-boss.</li><br>
 	<li><strong>WDI Student</strong>: 18-55, all walks of life. Nostalgia sets in after leaving GA and he/she wants to take a walk down memory lane, snag one last cig from Philippe, stun Jimmy with a teddy bear hug one last time for old time's sake.</li><br>
 	<li><strong>Eunice</strong>: 22, hardcore, 1337 skater. She wants to punch Andy in the face but he is not currently present. So she logs into Karma and smacks his smug little robot face around to her heart's content.</li>
</ul>

#Road Map
We would love to continue development working through our <a href="https://trello.com/b/RlWYsuPf/karma-game" target="_blank">Trello Board Backlog</a>:
<ul>
<li>User Login</li>
<li>User Profiles</li>
<li>Node Server with Database</li>
<li>Multiplayer Mode</li>
<li>High Score List</li>
<li>Heads Up Display</li>
</ul>

We would probably want to generalize the game mechanics and objects so that people outside of GA can be in on the hilarity. Or not.
